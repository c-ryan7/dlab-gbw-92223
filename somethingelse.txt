some text
we're gonna edit this! then try to remember the whole workflow for getting it up to github
first here is "i" for insert mode
then "Esc". then ":" for command mode... then type wq for "write" and "quit".

then we will... um... will we need to stage again? maybe we'll try commit without staging this file.
if not, we'll stage this file, then commit with a new message AND A SUBMESSAGE.... and then push
